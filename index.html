</p></div>
<hr width="70%" align="left">

<div class="text"><p>
I am currently a James Van Loo Postdoctoral Fellow and Assistant Professor (fixed-term) in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan. Previously, I was a
postdoctoral researcher in the research station "Geometry + Dynamics" at the Institute for Mathematics, Heidelberg University, working with JProf. Agustin Moreno on the AFOSR-funded project "Symplectic Methods in Space Mission Design". 
I am also on leave from my position as an NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Mission Design and Navigation (MDNav) Section of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. 
I completed my Ph.D. in 2022 from the School of Mathematics at Georgia Tech, advised by Prof. Rafael de la Llave and supported by a NASA NSTRF fellowship.
I also spent time during my Ph.D. as an NSTRF visiting technologist in MDNav at JPL, working with mentor Dr. Rodney Anderson. Prior to that, from 2014-2017 I was a co-op student in the Radio Science Systems Group at JPL. I hold an M.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering as well, also from Georgia Tech.

<div><h2>Research Interests</h2></div>

<div class="text"><p>
At a broad level, my interests lie in the application of tools and results from mathematical dynamical systems theory and symplectic geometry, both analytical
and computational, to various problems in celestial mechanics and applied astrodynamics for space mission design. In brief, there are geometric structures, such as periodic orbits,
invariant tori, and stable and unstable manifolds, which govern many of the important dynamical properties of multi-body celestial systems. I am interested in developing fast
and accurate methods for computing these objects as well as for investigating the dynamics induced by them. I am also working on applications of these methods to current and relevant
problems in astrodynamics, with a current focus on tour design in multi-moon systems and cislunar space using mean motion resonances.
